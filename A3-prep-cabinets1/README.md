##### Building Storage ([starter code and instructions](https://replit.com/@CarolineRose/CabinetsPart1-StarterCode#index.js))

###### Highlights: Objects | Functions & Methods | Arrays | Command Line Interface


 The project was to get familiar with JS objects and object methods by building a media console and storage cabinet.

The resulting app stores the console and cabinet as objects, then provides a number of useful methods to view and manipulate the media with the console and cabinet.

This project focuses on:
- objects and dot notation
- loops
- CLI, including building tables
- anonymous functions
