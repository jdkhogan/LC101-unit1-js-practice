	You are already familiar with the concept that objects hold key/value pairs and are useful for storing several properties together. What if the values of some of your keys are also data structures with multiple elements or properties of their own? Let's explore some different combinations and practice how to access and manipulate the data inside more complex objects.

/*
	HOT TIP: This series of exercises will print a lot of information to the console. I recommend each time you run it, you use the X at the top right of the console pane to completely clear the previous output first.

/**** PART 1: OBJECTS HOLDING PRIMITIVES AND ARRAYS ****/

/*
	This is not terribly complex just yet, but it's a good place to start. We have a single object, mediaConsole, which has 10 properties representing the items it holds. 
*/

let mediaConsole = {
	television: "Visio",
	receiver: "Onkyo",
	speakers: "Boston",
	streamingDevice: "Roku",
	dvdPlayer: "Panasonic",
	numDvds: 96, // Clearly I should do some spring cleaning...
	numCds: 383, // Don't judge. lol
	gamingConsoles: ["1986 NES", "2009 Wii"],
	numGames: [14, 9],
	decor: ["small vase", "desk clock", "photo in frame", "candle"]
};

/*
	PART 1
	
	Some of these keys have a single string or number as values, but others have arrays of strings or numbers. We can use dot notation OR bracket notation to access the properties of the object, but then we must also use bracket notation to access elements of any arrays.

	You always start with the main structure and work your way inward. 

	Syntax for object DOT notation: 
		object.property - for value of key
		object.property[index] - to get to elements of array

	Syntax for object BRACKET notation:
		object["property"] - for value of key
		object["property"][index] - to get to elements of array
*/

console.log("MEDIA CONSOLE *****************************\n")

// EXAMPLE: Print a sentence or two that talks about the specifics of the television, receiver, speakers, and streaming device. Use DOT notation for the object's properties.
console.log(`I have a ${mediaConsole.television} TV for my video output, and I use an ${mediaConsole.receiver} receiver with ${mediaConsole.speakers} speakers for audio. A separate ${mediaConsole.streamingDevice} streaming device lets me access channels like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Pandora, and more.\n`)

// TODO: Print a sentence or two that gives details about the DVD player, the DVDs, and the CDs. Use BRACKET notation for the object's properties, and don't forget the proper syntax where the property key is a string.


// EXAMPLE: Print a list of all the decorative objects on the media console, with each item on a new line. Use BRACKET NOTATION for object properties.
console.log("There are a few decorative items on my console:");
// Use a regular for loop to print each element from the array
for (let i=0; i < mediaConsole["decor"].length; i++) {
	// The first [ ] brackets are for the object property, and the second are for choosing the element in the array we're looping through.
	console.log(`\t${mediaConsole["decor"][i]}`);
}

// TODO: Print a list of gaming Consoles with both the name of the console and the corresponding number of games it has on each line. Use DOT notation.
console.log("\nI have a couple gaming consoles with a few titles.")
for (let i = 0; i < mediaConsole.gamingConsoles.length; i++) {
    console.log(`${mediaConsole.gamingConsoles[i]}: ${mediaConsole.numGames[i]} games`);
}

/*
	Okay, let's say I finally take the time to go through my DVDs and CDs and get rid of anything I can easily get online through a streaming service.
*/

// EXAMPLE: Reduce the number of DVDs by 80, and print a sentence stating the new value stored in the numDvds property.
mediaConsole.numDvds -= 80;
console.log(`\nAfter getting rid of a ton of my old DVDs, there are now only ${mediaConsole.numDvds} DVDs in my collection.`);

// TODO: Reduce the number of CDs by 341, and print a sentence stating the new value stored in the numCDs property.
mediaConsole.numCds -= 341
console.log(`\nI sold a bunch of my CDs at 7th Heaven, so there are now only ${mediaConsole.numCds} CDs in my collection.`);



/**** PARTS 2 & 3: OBJECTS WITH ARRAYS OF OBJECTS AND WITH METHODS ****/

/*
	Okay, before you look at the actual object below, let's look at its structure with a little pseudocode:

	Object
		first property, shelves
			array of 6 objects (top of cabinet, 4 shelves, & staging area)
				each one has 5 properties of its own:
				shelfName, books, bookends, frames, and vases
		second property, printTable - anonymous function

	Skip the PART 3 TODOs in the object for additional methods - you'll get back to those later.

	Right now let's focus on how we get to the data using what we've learned about objects and arrays. We will also practice changing the values of the data at the deepest level.

/* 
	PART 3

	Time to talk about object methods! Methods are properties that hold functions. This is commonly done with anonymous functions, but you can also refer to external functions (with their name but not parameters).

	Let's add some more functions to automate some processes as we rearrange the contents of the shelves. Inside the object itself, you must use "this" (e.g., this.shelves) to reference other properties and methods of the object. But outside the object, you always use the name of the object instead (e.g., cabinet).

	You will be working back and forth between writing the functions in the object above and calling the methods below. Remember that you must put a comma between each property/method inside the object.
*/

// EXAMPLE: Did you notice the first anonymous function stored in the printTable property of the object? This method features a neat little trick for displaying an array of objects in a chart in the console. Here's how you call it - attached to the named object, with () and any parameters (this particular method doesn't have any parameters though).
// TODO: Un-comment the line below and run the program to see the result.
cabinet.printTable();

// TODO: Write a method (in the object above) called countItems.
// TODO: Call the countItems method (below).
cabinet.countItems();

/*
	Now we have two different ways to report the data - the breakdown by shelf in a table and the totals in a sentence. We'll use these along the way in the other methods after we make changes. 
*/

/*
	Let's start by adding things to our cabinet. We've got some new books and vases.
