# LC-A5-Prep-3

The project was to create a Cocktail recipe app using the API from [The Cocktail DB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php)

The resulting app asks the user to select an optional category, then search by drink name or ingredient. The user must choose alcoholic drinks or mocktails, or both. If the user does not select a category or drink name/ingredient, the app returns the appropriate subset of drinks.

This project gave me additional practice on several aspects related to the DOM:
    - fetch functions and APIs
    - handling JSON objects in JS arrays
    - window, document and form event listeners
    - populating menus with loops
    - form validation
    - JS map and filter functions
    - mapping out default behavior (what should happens if user doesn't choose a category? ...drink type?)

Students - FORK this to your own account and then clone down to your local machine. Use the **starter-code** branch to code along with the video. You can also reference the **solution** branch to study my code.

Initially when you open the project in VSCode on your local computer, you will be in the main/master branch. Use the command 'git branch' in the terminal to view all available branches as shown below:

Then use 'git checkout starter-code' to switch to the starter-code branch:

If you wish to reference the solution, you can switch to that branch anytime as well.

This is part of a larger group of practice exercises and examples for students of LaunchCode's Web Development course (unit 1). See this document for the full list of repls, respositories, etc. https://tinyurl.com/y3bn6st4
