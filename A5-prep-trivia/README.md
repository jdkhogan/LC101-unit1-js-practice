# LC-A5-prep-2

The project was to create a Trivia app built on a publicly-available API: the [Open Trivia Database](http://opentdb.com/).

The resulting app asks the user to select number of questions, category, type of question (multiple choce or true/false) and difficulty. It then pulls a selection of questions from the API (using a token to ensure no duplicate questions), randomizes the question list, and provides real-time scoring.

This project gave me additional practice on several aspects related to the DOM:
    - fetch functions (async) and APIs
    - window, document, and form event listeners
    - form validation
    - building dynamic HTML pages with .innerHTML
    - building dropdown menus by looping 
    - constructing URLs with query parameters
    - shuffle function to randomize questions
    - real-time scoring function
