# LC-A6-prep

The project was to create a To-Do List app with basic CRUD functionality in Angular JS, working with pre-defined unit tests and alongside a demo video.

Since the app was designed to highlight JS front-end skills, it stores sample lists in the form of simple JS lists that can be manipulated during each runtime.

This project gave me additional practice on:
- basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality
- window, document and form event listeners
- form validation
- dynamically filling default values in editable forms
- passing complex parameters to JS methods
- custom CSS classes and booleans to toggle forms from hidden to visible
