# JavaScript practice - LaunchCode 101 Unit 1

The exercises in this repository were all provided as additional practice, with starter code and instructions or predefined unit tests. Whenever possible I worked independently to meet the project requirements, but occasionally followed along with the live-coding videos or solutions branches. 

I have copied over my finished code here as a unified repository, rather than including all commit histories.

The full list of practice exercises is a Google Doc: [Examples & Practice Problems](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x5QX5HfafZMVA7bkg6h-2C-ZlABO8Z_SRBrnKqJQ8FA/edit).
