# Modules Practice

##### A few quick practice exercises to reinforce working with modules.

###### Highlights: Modules | Constants | Functions | Objects | Template Literals | Ternary Operators | Command Line Interface

1. **Geometry**: Define the constant PI, and build functions to calculate:
        - Rectangle: area, perimter 
        - Square: defined as rectangle
        - Triangle: area, hypotensue of right triangle 
        - Circle: area, circumference

2. **Guess What**: build a Hangman / Wheel of Fortune style game given an array of clues and categories
        - Read in puzzles array and convert to an object
        - Mode select via user input
        - Template literals to print clues and prompts
        - Simple RegEx to validate input 

3. **Morse Code**: Build an app to translate letters, words, or phrases to Morse Code
