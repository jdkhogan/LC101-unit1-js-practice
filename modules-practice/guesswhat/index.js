	This is a little program I created when thinking about practice problems for students to prep for Graded Assignment 2, but it grew a little too big for that, and I decided to add a module. So it's just here for students who want a bit of a challenge.

	This loosely follows the guidelines in this document for how to approach a multi-function program:

******************* 

REGULAR MODE: You will be given a category and a phrase, and you can guess one letter at a time until you are ready to solve the puzzle. You start off with 200 points. Each turn will cost you points, so try to solve it as soon as possible! Here's how the scoring works:
    -5 points for correct letter (-10 if incorrect)
    +15 points for early solve (-15 if incorrect)

QUICK PLAY: The phrase will already have the most common letters filled in. You guess three more consonants and a vowel, then have one chance to solve the puzzle and win.
